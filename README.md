This repository contains the implementation of two Gymnasium environments for
the Flappy Bird game. The implementation of the game's logic and graphics was
based on the [flappy-bird-gym](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym) project, by
[@Talendar](https://github.com/Talendar). 

## State space

The "FlappyBird-rgb-v0" environment, yields RGB-arrays (images)
representing the game's screen. The "FlappyBird-v0" environment, on the other
hand, yields simple numerical information about the game's state as
observations.

### `FlappyBird-v0`
* horizontal distance to the next pipe
* the next top pipe's vertical position
* the next bottom pipe's vertical position
* horizontal distance to the next next pipe
* the next next top pipe's vertical position
* the next next bottom pipe's vertical position
* player's vertical position
* player's vertical velocity
* player's rotation

### `FlappyBird-rgb-v0`
The RGB image of size 288, 512 pixels. The pixel values are from range [0, 255]. The image does not contain score of bird.

## Action space

* 0 - **do nothing**
* 1 - **flap**

## Rewards

* +0.1 - **alive**
* +1.0 - **pipe**
* -1.0 - **dead**

## Installation

To install `flappy-bird-gymnasium`, simply run the following command:

    $ pip install flappy-bird-gymnasium
    
## Usage

Like with other `gymnasium` environments, it's very easy to use `flappy-bird-gymnasium`.
Simply import the package and create the environment with the `make` function.
Take a look at the sample code below:

```
import time
import flappy_bird_gymnasium
import gymnasium
env = gymnasium.make("FlappyBird-v0")

obs, _ = env.reset()
while True:
    # Next action:
    # (feed the observation to your agent here)
    action = env.action_space.sample()

    # Processing:
    obs, reward, terminated, _, info = env.step(action)
    
    # Rendering the game:
    # (remove this two lines during training)
    env.render()
    time.sleep(1 / 30)  # FPS
    
    # Checking if the player is still alive
    if terminated:
        break

env.close()
```

## Playing

To play the game (human mode), run the following command:

    $ flappy_bird_gymnasium
    
To see a random agent playing, add an argument to the command:

    $ flappy_bird_gymnasium --mode random
